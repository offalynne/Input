## Using a gamepad, verbs aren't working as expected, how do I correct this? {docsify-ignore}

1. Check if your gamepad is working OK on an OS level. On Windows, use the Game Controllers dialogue. See [Gamepad Troubleshooting](Gamepad-Troubleshooting) for additional details
2. Download the [example project](https://github.com/offalynne/Input/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) from GitHub and try out the `objTest200_ConsoleSuite` object. This helps visualize what's going on with your gamepad. You may need to cycle through gamepad indexes in some cases
3. Have a look at the [Output log](https://i.imgur.com/gy3CUcu.png) for more information on gamepad connection. If you need to follow up for additional help, we will need you to share the information you see here.

Some common issues to consider: remappers like Steam Input, DS4Windows, etc. may cause trouble, so try quitting these. Nintendo Switch controllers do not work on many platforms over USB, so try Bluetooth instead. Some devices require additional setup, see [Gamepad Troubleshooting](Gamepad-Troubleshooting) for additional details

## How can I check analogue input values (eg. trigger, thumbstick)? {docsify-ignore}

1. Set up your bindings using `InputDefineVerb()` in the `__InputConfigVerbs` script
2. Check verbs using `InputValue()`

&nbsp;

## Does Input support Steamworks? {docsify-ignore}

[Yes](Steamworks), using the [official extension](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-Steamworks)

&nbsp;

## How many simultaneous gamepads are supported? {docsify-ignore}

&nbsp;

## How do I update my project to a newer Input version? {docsify-ignore}

Please see [Importing The Library](Importing-The-Library) for detailed instructions.

&nbsp;

## How do I save and load player bindings? {docsify-ignore}

Using binding [export and import](Functions-(Rebindings)) functions. You should save bindings to a file for loading later.

&nbsp;

## How can multiple players share the keyboard or one gamepad between them? {docsify-ignore}

## Input is impacting my game's FPS! What should I do? {docsify-ignore}

Input is tested across platforms and we have yet to observe any scenario where it is the culprit for poor game performance. However, we recieve occasional reports regarding performance issues as a result of library user debugging confusion. 

If you believe Input is impacting performance based on profiler readings, **examine Time (Ms) and ignore Step (%)**. Unless Input is significantly contributing to a total Time (Ms) that is greater than your frame target (eg 17ms) the problem is elsewhere. 

Some known culprits for misdiagnosed performance issues are shaders, driver problems (Xbox controller related), and debugger Watches, all of which impact FPS in ways unrelated to the library, which the profiler may not make obvious. Feel free to pursue help for general performance problems, but **do not rely on Step (%)** for diagnosing or reporting library performance issues â€” **monitor (ms) values only**!

## How should I include Input in my game credits? {docsify-ignore}

Input Library: Juju Adams, Alynne Keith, and Friends
