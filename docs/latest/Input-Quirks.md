# Input Quirks

---

?> While this information is provided for your benefit, in the best of cases it can be ignored: it is our intent that Input permit otherwise-problematic scenarios to "just work". If you encounter undocumented platform-particular issues with Input, please consider [authoring a bug report](https://github.com/JujuAdams/Input/issues) or reaching us to discuss further [on Discord](https://discord.gg/8krYCqr).

Input works to normalize behavior across supported platforms. Each platform brings it's own eccentricities, so this work is ongoing. Herein notable issues and limitations will be documented that may impact users of Input in their implementations, or impact the experience of players of games that have implemented Input. For a list of upstream problems we are monitoring and related workarounds, see [upstream bug issues](https://github.com/JujuAdams/Input/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22upstream+bug+%F0%9F%92%A7%22+).
