/// Registers a callback to be executed at a suitable time by the library. The callback type
/// should be a member of the `INPUT_PLUG_IN_CALLBACK` enum.
/// 
/// N.B. Plug-ins may only register callbacks in the initialization callback defined by
///      `InputPlugInDefine()`. Calling `InputPlugInRegisterCallback()` outside of the
///      initialization callback with throw an error.
/// 
/// You may also specify a callback priority. Because many callbacks can be registered to any
/// particular callback type, and because code order might matter in some situations, it is useful
/// to be able to control what order callbacks are executed. Native library code always has a
/// priority of 0 and plug-ins cannot use a priority of 0. Higher priorities are executed first.
/// 
/// There are various different callback types that you can use. You will need to call
/// `InputPlugInRegisterCallback()` for each method you wish to attach. You may attach multiple
/// methods to the same callback (though we'd recommend using a different priority for each
/// callback to ensure execution order is consistent).
/// 
/// As previously mentioned, all of Input's internal code is executed with a priority of 0.
/// Callbacks with a higher priority are executed before internal code, callbacks with a lower
/// priority are executed after internal code. The table below describes what Input is doing itself
/// for each callback. Attaching a method before a callback allows you to set information that
/// Input will subsequently process. Attaching a method after a callback allows you to override
/// state that Input has set.
/// 
/// The table is organized, from top to bottom, in the rough order of execution per GameMaker step.
/// Not all callbacks will necessarily be executed every frame and some callbacks may be executed
/// multiple times a frame (for example, `.GAMEPAD_DISCONNECTED`). Some callbacks may be executed
/// at different times depending on other factors - the table is a guide.
