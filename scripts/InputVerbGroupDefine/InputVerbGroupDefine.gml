// Feather disable all

/// Defines a verb group and assigns verbs to it. A verb may be assigned to multiple verb groups.
/// This function should only be called in the `__InputVerbGroupsConfig()` script. Assigning a
/// verb to a verb group enables a few things:
/// 
/// 1. Verbs in a verb group can be deactivated en masse by calling `InputVerbGroupSetActive()`.
///    Deactivated verbs will have their raw value set to 0. If the verb is currently active (e.g.
///    a player is holding down a keyboard key) then the verb will be considered "released" for a
///    single frame after the verb group has been deactivated.
/// 
/// 2. Verbs that have the same binding would normally be considered as colliding for the purposes
///    of `InputBindingSetSafe()`. However, if two verbs share a binding but are in different verb
///    groups then they will instead not collide. For example, if one verb in is the "gameplay"
///    verb group and it shares a binding with a verb in the "menu" verb group then they won't
///    collide.
/// 
/// N.B. If a verb has not been assigned to any verb group then it will be treated as though it is
///      in every verb group for finding collisions.
/// 
/// @param verbGroupIndex
/// @param verbArray
